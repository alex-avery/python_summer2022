# Assignment instructions:
    # For the purposes of this exercise, we define three types of Twitter users.
        # Layman: Users with less than 100 followers
        # Expert: Users with 100-1000 followers
        # Celebrity: Users with more than 1000 followers
    # Using the Twitter API, and starting with the @WUSTLPoliSci twitter user, answer the following:
        # One degree of separation:
            # Among the followers of @WUSTLPoliSci who is the most active?
            # Among the followers of @WUSTLPoliSci who is the most popular, i.e. has the greatest number of followers?
            # Among the friends of @WUSTLPoliSci, i.e. the users she is following, who are the most active layman, expert and celebrity?
            # Among the friends of @WUSTLPoliSci who is the most popular?
        # Two degrees of separation: For the following two questions, limit your search of followers and friends to laymen and experts.
            # Among the followers of @WUSTLPoliSci and their followers, who is the most active?
            # Among the friends of @WUSTLPoliSci and their friends, who is the most active?
